print("this better work or im gonna cry")
#it works
#but it only works if changes are made in github n not in pycharm if my theory isn't wrong
#go to the git option in the top and click 'update project' and 'merge...'
#by doing this, ur updating the pycharm to this current one
#we chould do updates everytime we gotta test this so yeah
#once yalls have seen this imma erase this
